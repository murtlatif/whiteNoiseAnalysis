# QUESTIONS

- Figure 1. A) Doesn't gamma = 0 mean that its entirely the noisy signal? Its interesting to see that the correlation image is not clear
- Figure 1. Does B) cols. 1-4 show the average of the inputs?
- Figure 1. The * noise only section, does it mean the noise pattern n that includes the signal? Isn't that just the y=0 case


Biases from:
    1. Environment and the data where the system is trained
    2. System constraints (hypothesis class, model parameters)

Important to explore these biases because:
    1. Better understanding of a system
    2. Reveals system vulnerabilities, makes more robust against pertrubations & attacks

* Feeding white noise stimuli to a classifier & averaging the ones that are categorized into a class, we obtain an estimate
of the templates it uses for classification.
